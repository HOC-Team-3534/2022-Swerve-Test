Swerve Test

We got the swerve code from https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/swerve-drive-issues/392321

We may need to look into this in order to try to get PIDF settings configurations https://github.com/wpilibsuite/sysid

Great example of tuning pidf (feed forward should do most of the work!) https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/how-is-velocity-control-supposed-to-work-on-the-talon-srx/153630/7

Possible issues when configuring remote sensor feedback for talon FX https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/cancoder-is-not-connecting-to-our-talonfx-as-a-remote-sensor-properly/393943/16
